<p style="padding-left:10px;"><strong>What does it do?</strong>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">This script provides an easy method to creating remote folders
in your patch/sample library. For instance, you could place all
of your midis, samples, loops, etc., in a dropbox directory and
use this to quickly bridge FL Studio with a directory that is
located elsewhere. You may also use local server paths as well.</p>

<p style="padding-left:10px;><strong>What does it NOT do?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">* FTP Paths</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">* Remote Server Paths Requiring Authentication</p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">* Make FL more compliant with your procrastination. :p</p>

<p style="padding-left:10px;><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left:25px;">It simply creates a creates symbolic links which are pretty
much just shortcuts that work exactly the same way that folder
paths do with the exception that FL Studio recognizes them as
folders the same way that Windows (<i>and other apps</i>) do.</p>
