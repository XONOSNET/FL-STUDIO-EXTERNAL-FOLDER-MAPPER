<h2>FL STUDIO EXTERNAL FOLDER MAPPER</h2>
<p style="display:block;width:100%;text-align:center;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lWHLgrl.png"/></p>


<p>This batch script allows you to map remote folders (<i>either on a network share OR on your drive somewhere else</i>) to your patch/sample directory so that you don't have to physically import them. This especially works well with Dropbox/Onedrive/Google Drive folders.</p>
